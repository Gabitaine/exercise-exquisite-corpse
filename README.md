# A friend from afar

This is the story of a middle-aged womand - called Anne - living in Codeville.
Codeville is a small town in the middle of nowhere so no one really visits Anne.
Until one rainy morning, she sees a familiar silhouette standing in the frame of her front door.
"Oh my... would it be Coincoin?" _she asked to herself_ "I should go and check..."
_Anne approached to the door, slowly, as she felt her heart beating faster and faster, half scared-half intrigued._ Brian ? _She tried_ but no answer were made from the door.
